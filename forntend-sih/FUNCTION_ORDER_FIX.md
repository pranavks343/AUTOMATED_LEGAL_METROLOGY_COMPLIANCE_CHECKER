# 🔧 Function Order Fix - COMPLETED

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**

**Problem**: `NameError: name 'generate_suggestions' is not defined`

**Root Cause**: The `generate_suggestions` function was defined after it was being called in the code, violating Python's requirement that functions must be defined before they're used.

**Solution**: Moved the function definition to the top of the file and removed the duplicate definition.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **Before Fix (Problematic Structure)**
```python
# Main code starts here
require_auth()
st.title("🔍 Extraction")

# ... main application code ...

# Function call (line 152)
suggestions = generate_suggestions(fields, confidence_score, extracted_count)

# ... more code ...

# Function definition (line 370) - TOO LATE!
def generate_suggestions(fields, confidence_score, extracted_count):
    # Function implementation
```

### **After Fix (Correct Structure)**
```python
# Import statements
import streamlit as st
from pathlib import Path
# ... other imports ...

# Function definition (line 6) - NOW AT THE TOP!
def generate_suggestions(fields, confidence_score, extracted_count):
    """Generate intelligent suggestions based on extraction results"""
    # Function implementation
    
    return suggestions

# Main code starts here
require_auth()
st.title("🔍 Extraction")

# ... main application code ...

# Function call (now works correctly)
suggestions = generate_suggestions(fields, confidence_score, extracted_count)
```
