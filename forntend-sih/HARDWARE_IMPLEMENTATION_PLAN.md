### **ROI Calculation**

```
Initial Investment: ‚Çπ2,62,45,000
Annual Savings: ‚Çπ82,00,000
Annual Revenue: ‚Çπ75,00,000
Annual OpEx: ‚Çπ53,00,000

Net Annual Benefit: ‚Çπ82,00,000 + ‚Çπ75,00,000 - ‚Çπ53,00,000 = ‚Çπ1,04,00,000

ROI = (Net Annual Benefit / Initial Investment) √ó 100
ROI = (‚Çπ1,04,00,000 / ‚Çπ2,62,45,000) √ó 100 = 39.6% annually

Payback Period = Initial Investment / Net Annual Benefit
Payback Period = ‚Çπ2,62,45,000 / ‚Çπ1,04,00,000 = 2.5 years
```

**3-Year Financial Projection:**
- Year 1: -‚Çπ2,62,45,000 + ‚Çπ1,04,00,000 = -‚Çπ1,58,45,000
- Year 2: -‚Çπ1,58,45,000 + ‚Çπ1,04,00,000 = -‚Çπ54,45,000
- Year 3: -‚Çπ54,45,000 + ‚Çπ1,04,00,000 = +‚Çπ49,55,000
